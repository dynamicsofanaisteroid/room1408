# ROOM 1408  
*A classic haunted-room text game… with a twist.*

Inspired by Stephen King’s iconic short story *Room 1408* (and the excellent 2007 film adaptation), this game drops you into the shoes of Mike Enslin — a world-weary writer and professional debunker of haunted hotel rooms.

You’re expecting another disappointingly un-macabre night and a three-out-of-five skull review.  
But Room 1408 is not like the others.  
It’s not like any hotel room at all.

There’s something very, very wrong here.  
Try to survive. And, if you can… leave.


—> 🎮 How to Play

(You can also type `help` during gameplay for a list of available commands and reminders.)

From the moment you enter Room 1408, the haunting begins. You’ll need to observe, interact, and **outwit** the room’s twisted logic. Pay close attention to what changes… and when. And take note when a certain clock starts ticking. If it runs out before you do? Well… there have been fifty-eight natural deaths recorded in this room. You’d make a very pretty fifty-nine.

—> Available Commands:
- `look` – observe your current location
- `look at <object>` – examine something up close
- `take <object>` – attempt to acquire cursed items (great plan!)
- `use <object>` – interact with objects (results may vary)
- `north`, `south`, `east`, `west` – navigate the room and its shifting layout
- `quit` – you can try...

🕯️ *Tip: Not everything stays taken. And not every door leads where you think.*

—> How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/room1408.git

2. Navigate to the folder:

cd room1408

3. Run the game:

python3 1408.py


—> Why I Built It

I’m a newbie to coding, and I needed a project that would force Python into my brain in a way that was fun, challenging, and slightly terrifying (perfect match). I’m a project person, and I was stuck for inspiration — until one rainy night I rewatched one of my favourite creepy B-movies.

Lightning struck.

I realised that a haunted hotel room is the perfect metaphor for recursion, loops, and unstable state logic. The result: a text-based game that looks linear… until it isn’t.

—> Features and To-Do
The game is currently in development, with scenes and acts planned to mirror the structure of the film.

—> Coming Soon:

- Save/load feature (save to desktop as a file)

- More interactable objects

- Dynamic room state changes

- Alternate endings based on choices and survival time

—> So… Are You Really Mike Enslin?

Sadly, no — I lack both the acting skills and the cheekbones.

But I am Farah: an aspiring AI engineer and coder, interested in computer science, large language models, interactive storytelling, and all forms of genre-savvy digital mischief.

This is my first foray into programming a game — and one of several projects I’m documenting as I build a foundation in AI and software development.
